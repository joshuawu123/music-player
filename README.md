# music-player

A standard music player to help me get accustomed with C# and Visual Studio. Uses Windows Media Player in the backend. Still needs a lot of UI changes. 

## Features

Supports play/pause, shuffle, repeat, adding multiple songs, a seekbar that depicts the current position of the song and allows the user to travel to a point in the song, a volume slider, and a custom background image. 

## Usage

Run in Visual Studio IDE.

To set up a background image, just go to form1.cs => right-click the background => properties => BackgroundImage.
